## Rap ~ By ChatGPT

Bonus: I had ChatGPT make a rap for SQL, check it out and let us know if you like it!

Yo, what's up y'all, it's your boy here to speak,
About SQL and databases, it's not hard to seek,
A crucial skill for anyone in the tech scene,
So listen up and let me explain the scheme.

SQL is a language we use to manage data,
In relational databases, rows and columns we stack,
Create tables, insert, update, delete,
Retrieving data with complex queries, can't be beat.

A database is a collection of data,
Stored on a computer, it's not just a plate,
There's different types, like MySQL and MongoDB,
Apache Cassandra, and Microsoft SQL, can't deny.

Relational databases are organized in tables,
Rows and columns, it's not fables,
Each row represents a record, each column a field,
A customers table might have name, email, phone sealed.

So if you want to work with data,
SQL and databases are where it's at,
Efficient storage, retrieval, manipulation,
It's a skill you need, no hesitation.
