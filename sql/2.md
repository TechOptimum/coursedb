I will personally be using Linux to demonstrate the commands however feel free to use the OS of your liking.

## Postgres Specific Commands

PostgreSQL uses the backslash(\) to signify the beginning of any system-specific command. These are not global SQL commands and are specific only to Postgres. You can find a list of the same [here](https://www.notion.so/Database-Basics-Schema-2bc3b23b4b3a41e1934612662977b342). You do not have to memorize or even go through all of them. Just search them up as you go and they will be part of your memory in no time.
