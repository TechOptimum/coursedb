## Creating A Database

```sql
-- Creating a database called "mydb"
CREATE DATABASE mydb;

-- Listing all the databases and checking if its added
\l

-- Connecting to the database
\c mydb
```

## Creating A Table

Coming to the SQL part. Before we start adding and updating data, we need a table to store it. 

```sql
-- Creating A Table
CREATE TABLE accounts (
	user_id VARCHAR ( 50 ),
	username VARCHAR ( 50 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR ( 255 ) UNIQUE
);

-- Verifying if the table has been created (listing all tables)
\dt
```

The following code creates a table called “accounts” with the columns user_id, username, password, email and created_on. It then goes on to specify the data type to be stored in those columns; we will learn about data types like *VARCHAR* later on in the course. It also specifies whether their values should all be different from each other or not and if the field is optional or compulsory. 

## Inserting, Updating & Deleting Rows

To insert a new record into a table, you can use the **`INSERT INTO`** statement. Here is the basic syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

For example, to insert a new customer into the "customers" table, you can use the following statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Smith', 'john@example.com');
```

This statement inserts a new row into the "customers" table, with the values 'John Smith' and '**[john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)**' for the "name" and "email" columns, respectively.

To update an existing record in a table, you can use the **`UPDATE`** statement. Here is the basic syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
```

For example, to update the email address of a customer in the "customers" table, you can use the following statement:

```sql
UPDATE customers SET email = 'john.smith@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Smith';
```

This statement updates the "email" column of the row where the "name" column is equal to 'John Smith'.

To delete an existing record from a table, you can use the **`DELETE`** statement. Here is the basic syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## Data Types

In SQL, data types are used to specify the kind of data that can be stored in a table column. Different data types are used for different types of data, such as numbers, text, or dates. Here are a few examples of common data types in SQL:

- **INTEGER**
    - This data type is used for storing whole numbers. For example, you might use an *INTEGER* data type to store a person's age or the number of items in an order.
- **CHAR**
    - This data type is used for storing text strings of a fixed length. For example, you might use a *CHAR* data type to store a person's initials or a product code.
- **VARCHAR**
    - This data type is similar to *CHAR*, but it can store text strings of a variable length. For example, you might use a *VARCHAR* data type to store a person's name or a product description.
- **DATE**
    - This data type is used for storing dates. It typically includes the year, month, and day. For example, you might use a *DATE* data type to store the date an order was placed or a person's birthday.

When you create a table in SQL, you need to specify the data type for each column. This helps to ensure that the data is stored and organized correctly in the table.

Now, let's talk about table structure in SQL. Imagine you are organizing a party for your friends. You want to make a list of everyone who is coming and what they are bringing to the party. You could create a table with two columns: one for the name of the person, and one for the item they are bringing.

In SQL, this table might look something like this (as mentioned before):

```sql
CREATE TABLE party (
  name VARCHAR(50),
  item VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example, the table is called "party" and it has two columns: "name" and "item". The "name" column is of data type VARCHAR(50), which means it can store text strings of up to 50 characters in length. The "item" column is of data type VARCHAR(100), which means it can store text strings of up to 100 characters in length.

As you can see, the table structure in SQL is like the skeleton of the table, defining what data can be stored and how it is organized. By specifying the data types and column names, you can create a table that is tailored to your needs and can store the data you need in a clear and organized way.

## Primary Keys

A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. It is a special kind of data type that is used to enforce the uniqueness of the values in the column.

A primary key column cannot contain null values and must contain a unique value for each row in the table. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.

Here is an example of how to create a table with a primary key column in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example, the "id" column is the primary key column. It is of data type INTEGER, which means it can only store whole numbers. The **`PRIMARY KEY`** keyword is used to specify that this column is the primary key for the table.

It is important to have a primary key in a table because it helps to uniquely identify each row and ensures the integrity of the data. For example, if you need to update a specific row in the table, you can use the primary key value to locate it quickly and accurately.

In summary, a primary key is a special data type in SQL that is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. It is an important element of the table structure and helps to ensure the integrity of the data.

## Selecting, Filtering & Sorting Data

Retrieving data from a database is a common task in SQL, and there are many ways to do it. In this tutorial, we will go over the basics of selecting, filtering, and sorting data using SQL statements.

First, let's start with the basics of selecting data. The **`SELECT`** statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Here's an example of a simple **`SELECT`** statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

This statement retrieves all the columns and rows from the "customers" table. The **`*`** wildcard is used to select all columns. You can also specify specific columns to retrieve, like this:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM customers;
```

This statement retrieves just the "name" and "email" columns from the "customers" table.

Now, let's talk about filtering data. Filtering is used to narrow down the results of a **`SELECT`** statement by specifying certain criteria. This is done using the **`WHERE`** clause. Here's an example of a **`SELECT`** statement with a **`WHERE`** clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
```

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, but only for customers who live in New York. The **`WHERE`** clause specifies the criteria for the filter: in this case, it is looking for rows where the "city" column is equal to 'New York'. You can use different operators in the **`WHERE`** clause, such as **`<`**, **`>`**, and **`LIKE`**, to specify different types of criteria (discussed in more detail in the next section).

Now, let's talk about sorting data. Sorting is used to arrange the results of a **`SELECT`** statement in a specific order. This is done using the **`ORDER BY`** clause. Here's an example of a **`SELECT`** statement with an **`ORDER BY`** clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name;
```

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, and sorts the results by the "name" column. By default, the sort order is ascending (A-Z). You can use the **`DESC`** keyword to sort in descending order (Z-A).

Here's an example that combines all three concepts: selecting, filtering, and sorting:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York' ORDER BY name DESC;
```

This statement retrieves the "name" and "email" columns from the "customers" table, but only for customers who live in New York. The results are sorted by the "name" column in descending order (Z-A).

That's it! With these basics, you should be able to select, filter, and sort data using SQL statements. Don't worry if it seems a bit confusing at first – with a little bit of practice, it will start to make more sense. Just think of it like searching for a specific book in a library: you can use the **`SELECT`** statement to find the right shelf, the **`WHERE`** clause to narrow down the search to a specific section, and the **`ORDER BY`** clause to arrange the books in the way that makes the most sense to you.

## Operators

Operators are used to specify conditions in the **`WHERE`** clause of a **`SELECT`** statement (we have used a few in the previous section). They are used to compare values and filter the results of a query based on those comparisons.

Here is a list of common operators in SQL and what they do:

Here are some examples of how to use these operators in a **`SELECT`** statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age = 30;
```

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, but only for customers who are 30 years old.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city <> 'New York';
```

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, but only for customers who do not live in New York.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 40;
```

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, but only for customers who are between 20 and 40 years old.

You can also use multiple operators in a single **`WHERE`** clause to specify more complex criteria. For example, here is a statement that retrieves all columns and rows from the "customers" table, but only for customers who are over 30 years old **and** live in either New York or Chicago.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city IN ('New York', 'Chicago') AND age > 30;
```
