Make these 2 functions

1. Add a function named `list_benefits()` that returns the following list of strings: `"More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse", "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"`
2. Add a function named `build_sentence(info)` which receives a single argument containing a string and returns a sentence starting with the given string and ending with the string `" is a benefit of functions!"`
- Example code (Spoiler)
    
    ```python
    def list_benefits():
    	return["More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse", "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"]
    def build_sentence(info):
    	return(info+" is a benefit of functions")
    ```
