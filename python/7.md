# Student Gradebook

1. Store the names and grades of a fixed number of students (e.g., 5). You can store the data in variables, lists, or a dictionary.
2. Prompt the user to enter a student name and a grade (e.g., "John Smith", 85).
3. Check if the student is in the gradebook. If they are, update their grade. If they are not, add them to the gradebook.
4. Calculate the average grade for all students.a
5. Print the name and grade of the student with the highest grade.
6. Print the names and grades of all students sorted by name (ascending).
7. Prompt the user to enter a letter grade (e.g., "A", "B", "C").
8. Print the names and grades of all students with grades that match the letter grade.

## **Tips**

- You can use the **`input()`** function to prompt the user for input.
- You can use the **`if`** and **`elif`** statements to check the letter grade.
- You can use the **`sorted()`** function to sort a list of students by name.
- You can use the **`format()`** method to print the name and grade of a student.
