In Python, a module is a file that contains definitions and statements. You can use modules to organize your code and reuse it across multiple programs.

## Importing Modules

To use a module in your code, you need to import it using the import statement. For example, the math module contains a variety of mathematical functions, so you can import it and use its functions like this:

```python
import math

x = math.sqrt(9)
print(x)  # Output: 3.0
```

You can also import specific functions from a module using the **`from`** keyword, like this:

```python
from math import sqrt

x = sqrt(9)
print(x)  # Output: 3.0
```

## Creating Modules

To create a module, you just need to create a new Python file and write your code in it. For example, let's say you want to create a module called **`greeting`** with a function called **`say_hello()`** that prints "Hello, World!". The module would look like this:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

To use this module in your code, you can import it and use the **`say_hello()`** function like this:

```python
import greeting

greeting.say_hello()  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

You can also use the **`from`** keyword and the **`import`** statement to import specific functions from a module, like this:

```python
from greeting import say_hello

say_hello()  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

Lastly, You can use as many modules as you need in your code. Just use multiple **`import`** statements to import the modules you need. For example:

```python
import math
import greeting

x = math.sqrt(9)
print(x)  # Output: 3.0

greeting.say_hello()  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```
