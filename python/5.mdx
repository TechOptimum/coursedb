In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. You can use dictionaries to store data in a more organized way than with lists.

## Creating Dictionaries

To create a dictionary, use curly braces **`{}`** and include a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. The key and value are separated by a colon **`:`**.

For example:

```python
# Create a dictionary of names and ages
people = {
    "Alice": 30,
    "Bob": 35,
    "Charlie": 25
}

# Create a dictionary of phone numbers
phones = {
    "Alice": "555-1234",
    "Bob": "555-2345",
    "Charlie": "555-3456"
}

```

You can also create an empty dictionary and add key-value pairs later using the syntax **`dictionary[key] = value`**.

```python
# Create an empty dictionary
empty = {}

# Add a key-value pair
empty["Alice"] = 30
empty["Bob"] = 35
empty["Charlie"] = 25

```

### **Accessing Dictionary Values**

To access the value of a key in a dictionary, use the syntax **`dictionary[key]`**. For example:

```python
# Get Alice's age
age = people["Alice"]
print(age)  # Output: 30

# Get Bob's phone number
phone = phones["Bob"]
print(phone)  # Output: "555-2345"

```

If you try to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, you will get a **`KeyError`**. You can use the **`in`** keyword to check if a key is in a dictionary before accessing it.

```python
# Check if "Alice" is in the dictionary
if "Alice" in people:
    # Get Alice's age
    age = people["Alice"]
    print(age)  # Output: 30

# Check if "Dave" is in the dictionary
if "Dave" in people:
    # This code will not be executed because "Dave" is not in the dictionary
    age = people["Dave"]
    print(age)

```

### **Modifying Dictionary Values**

To modify the value of a key in a dictionary, use the syntax **`dictionary[key] = value`**. For example:

```python
# Set Alice's age to 31
people["Alice"] = 31

# Set Bob's phone number to "555-9876"
phones["Bob"] = "555-9876"

```

### **Removing Key-Value Pairs**

To remove a key-value pair from a dictionary, use the **`del`** keyword. For example:

```python
# Remove Alice's age from the dictionary
del people["Alice"]

# Remove Bob's phone number from the dictionary
del phones["Bob"]

```

### **Iterating Over Dictionaries**

You can use a **`for`** loop to iterate over the keys in a dictionary. For example:

```python
# Print the names of all people in the dictionary
for name in people:
    print(name)  # Output: "Bob", "Charlie"

# Print the phone numbers of all people in the dictionary
for name in

```
